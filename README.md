# motorola-test

My approach to Motorola's Acadamy is "drop everything and start anew". I don't have any technical education but I always thought I can find myself well in a programmer job. My parents completely changed their professions after their 50s, so now I know for a fact it is never too late to change your life. I want to grow and learn new things. I believe working as a programmer for Motorola will allow me to do just that. I feel it's time for a new adventure!
